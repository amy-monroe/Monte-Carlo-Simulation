[Link to Deployed Version](https://earnest-choux-63a32e.netlify.app/)

## Overview

Monte Carlo simulations represent a powerful statistical technique, combining stochastic processes and mathematical modeling to estimate complex scenarios. In this context, stochastic processes involve random, probabilistic phenomena evolving over time or iterations. This simulation serves the purpose of approximating the value of Pi (π) using a Monte Carlo approach.

## Estimation Formula

The fundamental formula used for this estimation is:

$$π ≈ 4 \cdot \left(\frac{{\text{Number of Points Inside the Circle}}}{{\text{Total Number of Points Generated}}}\right)$$

The simulation offers a practical demonstration of probability, geometry, and stochastic processes. It accomplishes this by randomly distributing points within a unit square and discerning if each point falls inside a unit circle. The ratio of points inside the circle to the total points generated provides an approximation of Pi.

## Operational Procedure

This simulation utilizes a canvas to visualize the process, as described below:

1. A unit square is delineated.
2. Points are randomly generated within the square.
3. If a point falls inside the unit circle (centered within the square), it's marked in blue; otherwise, it's marked in red.
4. The estimated value of Pi is continuously updated based on the ratio of points inside the circle to the total points generated.
