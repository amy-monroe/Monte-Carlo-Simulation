# Monte Carlo Simulation

## Introduction

Monte Carlo simulations constitute a statistical method that integrates stochastic processes and mathematical modeling to approximate intricate scenarios. Stochastic processes, in this context, refer to random, probabilistic phenomena that evolve over time or through iterations. This simulation focuses on approximating the value of Pi (π) using a Monte Carlo approach.

## The Formula

The fundamental formula used for this estimation is:
$$π ≈ 4 \cdot \left(\frac{{\text{Number of Points Inside the Circle}}}{{\text{Total Number of Points Generated}}}\right)$$

This simulation demonstrates the application of probability, geometry, and stochastic processes. By randomly distributing points within a unit square and determining if each point falls inside a unit circle, we can approximate Pi.

## How It Works

In this simulation, we use a canvas to visualize the process. Here's a simplified explanation:

1. A unit square is drawn.
2. Points are randomly generated within the square.
3. If a point falls inside the unit circle (centered within the square), it's marked in blue; otherwise, it's marked in red.
4. The estimated value of Pi is continuously updated based on the ratio of points inside the circle to the total points generated.
